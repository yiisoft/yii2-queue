Upgrading Instructions
======================

This file contains the upgrade notes. These notes highlight changes that could break your
application when you upgrade the package from one version to another.

Upgrade from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
---------------------------

* The [Amqp driver](docs/guide/driver-amqp.md) has been deprecated. You can still use till 3.0 release where it will be removed. It is advised to migrate to [Amqp Interop]((docs/guide/driver-amqp-interop.md)).  

Upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
---------------------------

* `yii\queue\cli\Verbose` behavior was renamed to `yii\queue\cli\VerboseBehavior`. Old class was
  marked as deprecated and will be removed in `2.1.0`.

* `Job`, `RetryableJob` and `Serializer` interfaces were renamed to `JobInterface`,
  `RetryableJobInterface` and `SerializerInterface`. Old names are declared as deprecated
  and will be removed in `2.1.0`.

Upgrade from 1.1.0 to 2.0.0
---------------------------

* Code has been moved to yii namespace. Check and replace `zhuravljov\yii` to `yii` namespace for
  your project.

Upgrade from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
---------------------------

* Event `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_EXEC_ERROR` renamed to `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_ERROR`.

* Removed method `Queue::later()`. Use method chain `Yii::$app->queue->delay(60)->push()` instead.

* Changed table schema for DB driver. Apply migration.


Upgrade from 0.x to 1.0.0
-------------------------

* Some methods and constants was modified.
  
  - Method `Job::run()` modified to `Job::execute($queue)`.
  - Const `Queue::EVENT_BEFORE_WORK` renamed to `Queue::EVENT_BEFORE_EXEC`.
  - Const `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_WORK` renamed to `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_EXEC`.
  - Const `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_ERROR` renamed to `Queue::EVENT_AFTER_EXEC_ERROR`.

* Method `Queue::sendMessage` renamed to `Queue::pushMessage`. Check it if you use it for yourself
  drivers.


Upgrade from 0.10.1
-------------------

* Driver property was removed and this functionality was moved into queue classes. If you use public
  methods of `Yii::$app->queue->driver` you need to use methods of `Yii::$app->queue`. 
  
  And you need to check your configs. For example, now config for db queue see:
  
  ```php
  'queue' => [
      'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\db\Queue::class,
      'db' => 'db',
      'tableName' => '{{%queue}}',
      'channel' => 'default',
      'mutex' => \yii\mutex\MysqlMutex::class,
  ],
  ```
 
  Instead of old variant:
 
  ```php
  'queue' => [
      'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\Queue::class,
      'driver' => [
          'class' => \yii\queue\db\Driver::class,
          'db' => 'db',
          'tableName' => '{{%queue}}'
          'channel' => 'default',
          'mutex' => \yii\mutex\MysqlMutex::class,
      ],
  ],
  ```
